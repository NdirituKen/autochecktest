i used Katalon Studio to come up with the script. Katalon uses groovy language. To run this, clone the repo to your desktop. Change the username and password test case details to run since i think my account has been closed. On the test cases folder, execute the test case named End2end by double clicking on it to open it and then clicking on the green play button at the top panel. If you are just reading the code, locate the test cases folder and view.
